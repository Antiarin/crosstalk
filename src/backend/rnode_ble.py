"""RNode BLE discovery and macOS compatibility helpers.

Reticulum's desktop RNode BLE support currently assumes that a scanner can
read an operating-system bond flag. CoreBluetooth does not expose the BlueZ
``Bonded`` property, and it represents device addresses as UUIDs instead of
Bluetooth MAC addresses. On macOS that makes otherwise reachable RNodes fail
Reticulum's pre-connection filter.

Crosstalk keeps the workaround deliberately narrow: only Darwin uses the
replacement filter, the device must advertise the RNode UART service, and
Bleak/CoreBluetooth still performs the real connection and authentication.
